# On-The-Map
A map-based app that shows information posted by other students at **Udacity**. The map contains pins that show the location where other students have reported studying. By tapping on the pin users can link to a URL. The user is able to add and update their own data by posting a string that can be reverse geocoded to a location, and a URL.

This was the *first* project in the *second* term of my iOS Nanodergree.
